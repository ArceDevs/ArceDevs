> Despite the lack of experience, it is essential to persevere with hard work ‚Äî Me üòä

Hello, I'm Alonso, just a young sprout in the vast world of coding.<br>
To sum it up, I‚Äôm all about curiosity and hard work.<br>
I'm the type of person that prefers to dive into code, mess around, and then figure out how to make the rubish I write into something actually usable and scalable üòÇ


# `<>` Present `</>`
I‚Äôm trying to keep up with the latest frontend frameworks while also staying current on the backend side with AI. <br>
It feels like I'm biting off more than I can chew at times, but there's so much to learn that even with heaps of free time, keeping up seems impossible.

Right now, I've got three tabs open that I do in my spare time:
<ul>
	<li>
		I‚Äôm the lead developer for the <a href="https://www.gtdebarcelona.es/" target="_blank">GT de Barcelona</a> which is a Warhammer 40K tournament set for September 2024.
	</li>
	<li>I‚Äôm tackling two Udemy bootcamps: one on Python and another on ASP.NET.</li>
	<li>
		I‚Äôm diving deep into JavaScript, my daily go-to language, and trying to stay on top of global programming news.<br>
		Thankfully, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ThePrimeTimeagen" target="_blank">ThePrimeagen</a>'s content is helping with that if you are interested on those topics üòÅ
	</li>
</ul>


# `<>` Skills `</>`
Even though, I don't have that much experience I managed to learn a little of mutiple things in order to see why there are so many tools and why should I use them.<br>
Also whether it is good or bad, I've worked with JavaScript long enough to hate it, but I still use it. Happends ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è<br>

_üî• IMPORTANT üî•_ <br>
_The skills presented are ordered by how much I have used/known about them from left to right!_ <br>
_Also, there are other tools or languages I have used, I'm not going to add them. Because I haven't done anything significant with them_ <br>
_For example, I have written some scripts with bash, but nothing to far away from a measely Hello World and I did set up some servers on Linux while I was studying, but again it isn't something I can rely on currently as knowlege to apply into real projects_ <br>
